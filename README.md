# Principal Components Analysis - Eigenfaces

Matlab program that computes the principal components of an image set (eigen values) in order to perform a change of basis driving to a space reduction. It's a good way to do face recognition while reducing the dimensions of the data.

When you run "lectureYale.m", you have to select the directory "CroppedYale_d" in the file browser.

"AnalyseReussite.m" analyzes the error between an image and its reconstruction from the eigenface subspace to the original space, in function of the number of eigen values used to construct the eigenface subspace. It also generates the corresponding graphes.

I've provided a zip archive "res.zip" containing all the execution results.
